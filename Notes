Use the example 3 of js examples to see how to parse json text in
newwin example comes up in the assignment
ajax demo, use js to make a request to server - not the browser. we're not using xml even tho the name says get xml
xmlonload - when it's finished loading - this could be after user enters their shit and hits enter
we will be doing something like ajax demo in the assignment
might have to use the canvas example to display images from the api - use getimage js in third example
