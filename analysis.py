# In the code you provided, job_scores_total is a dictionary that will contain the total score for each job. The
# outer for loop iterates over each item in the job_scores dictionary, which contains a mapping of each job to a list
# of scores representing how important each personality trait is for that job.
#
# Inside the outer loop, a new variable total is initialized to 0. The inner for loop then iterates over each item in
# the responses dictionary, which maps each question number to the user's response (a score from 1 to 5) for that
# question.
#
# For each question, the score for the corresponding personality trait is looked up in the scores list using the
# question number as an index (scores[qno-1]). This score is then multiplied by the user's response for that question
# (response), and the result is added to the running total (total += response * scores[qno-1]).
#
# Once all questions have been processed for a given job, the total score for that job is stored in the
# job_scores_total dictionary using the job name as the key (job_scores_total[job] = total).
#
# This process is repeated for each job in the job_scores dictionary, resulting in a final dictionary
# job_scores_total containing the total score for each job. The job with the highest score represents the best match
# for the user's personality traits, and can be returned as the recommended job.
